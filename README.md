This folder contains a collection of beginner-level Python projects created as part of my self-learning journey. Each program focuses on building foundational programming skills such as conditionals, loops, functions, and file handling. 
Projects Included:
– Basic Calculator

All code is written in Python 3 and continuously improved as I learn more advanced topics.
